# MS-DeJoC
This is the PyTorch implementation for our paper:**Decoupling Joint-Optimized Co-Teaching Strategy For Fine-Grained Visual Recognition**

## Network Architecture
The architecture of our proposed MS-DeJoC model is as follows

## Setups
 - **Environment**
After creating a virtual environment of python 3.7, run `pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

 - **Data Preparation**
Download these web fine-grained datasets, namely [Web-CUB][1], [Web-Car][2] and [Web-Aircraft][3]. Then uncompress them into `./data` directory.

## Running
According to your own demand, modify the corresponding parameters in `Main_ms_dejoc.py`, such as `--bs`, `--net`, `--data`, `--gpu`, etc. You can also directly run `Main_ms_dejoc.py` to get the final result.
